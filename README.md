# Football Dictionaries Project

## Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to transform and organize football player data. The original data is a list of lists, where each player is represented by a list containing various attributes such as number, position, name, date of birth, club, country, and more.

## Data  
For this project, I used a simplified version of squads data with a small sample of players to demonstrate the transformation and grouping.

## Assignments

- **Assignment 1:** Convert the list of lists into a list of dictionaries for better data accessibility.  
- **Assignment 2:** Group players by their position into a dictionary.  
- **Assignment 3:** Further group players by country, and inside each country, group by position.
